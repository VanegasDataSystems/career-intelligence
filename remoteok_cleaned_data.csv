Our philosophy is guided by five core principles Maintainability First: We stay closely attuned to industry trends but choose our tools with the discretion that healthcare technology demands. We reach first for battle-tested, well-supported technologies that allow us to deliver business value quickly and ensure reliability for the patients and clinicians that depend on us. Our engineers take pride in solutions that are built to last and simple to maintain. Mindful Innovation: As technical experts, we must lead the charge in uncovering opportunities for innovation and automation across our business. We encourage the use of emergent technologies when they provide a clear, measurable impact for our most pressing business problems. Our engineers are innovators who can justify their choices with expertise and professional wisdom. Extreme Ownership: Our engineers carry a deep sense of personal accountability for everything they ship. We aren't satisfied with just completing the requirements in a ticket; we partner with stakeholders and dive deeply into business problems to ensure we are building the right thing, often identifying gaps in requirements well before they become problems in production. We view thorough documentation and rigorous self-testing of our code as non-negotiable parts of the job'not for the sake of process, but because we refuse to leave the success of our work to chance. Business-Focused Engineering: We don't measure success by the frequency of releases or the number of tickets closed, but by the outcomes that we drive for our clinicians and patients. We expect every engineer on our team to possess a keen ""business sense""'to understand the why behind a request before diving into the how. It is our responsibility to develop a deep understanding of our stakeholders' pain points and proactively propose technical solutions that address them with accuracy. Simplicity over Complexity : We strive to write software that is simple, clear and approachable, allowing new engineers to open pull requests within their first week on the job. We are careful to avoid speculative abstractions, experimental design patterns, and other forms of over-engineering that make our systems difficult to understand, debug, and maintain.","['software', 'design', 'system', 'frontend', 'back-end', 'python', 'django', 'full-stack', 'docker', 'technical', 'director', 'code', 'web', 'travel', 'devops', 'cloud', 'leader', 'strategy', 'management', 'lead', 'senior', 'operations', 'analytics', 'reliability', 'healthcare', 'engineer', 'engineering', 'digital nomad', 'Management Services Organization', 'Services Organization', 'Medicare population', 'neglected Advanced illness', 'life patient population', 'Django REST Framework', 'Management Services', 'Senior Full Stack', 'Cloud', 'Cloud SQL']"

What does that mean? It means we are a serious company that doesn't take itself too seriously; and we're looking for people who love to get stuff done, and laugh a bit along the way. We're growing rapidly - looking for collaborative, curious, and motivated team members who are passionate about putting customers first. As a remote-first company we believe in empowering our employees to do their best work, wherever they are. 

As the data engine for IT and Security many of the biggest names in the most demanding industries trust Cribl to solve their most pressing data needs. Ready to do the best work of your career? Join the herd and unlock your opportunity.

Why You'll Love This Role
Platform Engineering at Cribl is responsible for creating and maintaining the foundational software infrastructure that supports our entire ecosystem of products. This includes scalable systems, shared services, developer tools, and core components that other product teams rely on to build customer-facing features quickly and reliably.

As a Software Engineer I on the Core Platform team, you'll join a group of engineers building the backend systems and APIs that ingest, process, and route massive volumes of observability and security data. This is an ideal role for someone early in their career (new grad or entry-level) who's excited to learn, ship real features, and grow with mentorship from senior engineers.

'¢ You'll work on real distributed backend systems that handle high-volume metrics and telemetry data, not toy problems.
'¢ You'll have strong mentorship from senior and staff engineers, with clear expectations for learning and growth.
'¢ You'll get exposure to time-series databases, cloud platforms, and CI/CD pipelines, building a foundation in modern platform engineering.
'¢ You'll be part of a remote-first team that values curiosity, collaboration, clear communication, and of course'¦ goats.

As An Active Member Of Our Team, You Will...
'¢ Learn and contribute to backend systems and APIs that ingest, process, and route data, implementing well-scoped features and bug fixes with guidance from more senior engineers.
'¢ Design, develop, test, and maintain clear, maintainable code in Node.js/TypeScript that delivers the right outcomes for our customers, starting with smaller, well-defined tasks and growing into more complex work over time.
'¢ Collaborate with a cross-functional team of engineers, designers, and product managers to understand requirements, ask clarifying questions, and turn feature specifications into implementable stories and code.
'¢ Write and extend automated tests (unit, integration, and functional) for the code you ship, following existing test plans and patterns and contributing to new test cases as you gain experience.
'¢ Participate in code reviews: both as an author and a reviewer-in-training'incorporating feedback to improve code quality, testing, and readability while learning from more experienced teammates.
'¢ Help investigate and fix bugs in collaboration with senior engineers, learning how to use logs, metrics, and other observability tools to understand and debug distributed systems.
'¢ Support performance and correctness work around time-series data storage and query paths by pairing with teammates and tackling well-bounded tasks that improve reliability and efficiency.
'¢ Develop good engineering habits: writing tests","['software', 'security', 'support', 'developer', 'test', 'code', 'cloud', 'senior', 'reliability', 'engineer', 'engineering', 'backend', 'digital nomad', 'engineers', 'senior engineers', 'data', 'Core Platform team', 'team', 'backend systems', 'systems', 'Platform Engineering', 'work', 'Role Platform Engineering']"

1129672,JLS Trading Co,Product Inventor Engineer @ Fun Ecom Co,,https://remoteOK.com/remote-jobs/remote-product-inventor-engineer-fun-ecom-co-jls-trading-co-1129672,"- Do you see crappy products everywhere and think ""I could make that so much better""? - Does your brain refuse to stop solving problems, even when you're supposed to be relaxing? - Do you thrive in a high-stress environment filled with political infighting, bureaucracy, and corporate nonsense? If so, then we are the place for you, except you might hate how nice of a company we have - filled with happy, generally competent people that don't put up with jerks. Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is. We are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me. --Is this a real job ad?-- Yup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of different job sites. And it's not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the owner just started paying our 70ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons - we're big time, people. Our careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we're a pretty big deal): http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/ And check out our reviews on Google , Glassdoor , or Indeed to see that it's not just the founder's mother who says we're cool. --What do you guys do?-- We do a lot of different things these days including selling awesome consumer products (these are just a small sampling):Â - Bad Parking Cards ( https://amz.run/5Eya ) - Beverage Barricades ( https://amz.run/6kip ) - Child Chucker ( https://amz.run/9EUz ) Running this Amazon Pay-Per-Click agency: PPCFarm.com (we're really, really good at PPC) And we will soon be launching a SaaS product for inventory management. We are doing our best to grow rapidly every year, and it's our intention to continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help us keep up with the growth. --What is your company like?-- 1. You Can Be Yourself. You don't have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO (highly encouraged), and no one will think anything of it. You don't have to dress up, or use formal language, or pretend to be something you're not - you can just be you. 2. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn't matter what your credentials are ' it matters what you get done. 3. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your pajamas, on your schedule. And we don't care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot of work done, we're happy campers. 4. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you're routinely working more than 45ish hours, you're gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest. 5. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done. 6. No Micro-Management. Once you're trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren't the place for you. 7. No Toxic/Incompetent People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean or stupid people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. You will never have to interact with someone who is an obvious idiot or straight up malicious. No toxic or incompetent people at work - could it really be? [Yes] 8. Supportive Environment. We don't operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful ' internal politics are at a minimum here. 9. Lots of Raises. We do our absolute best to get ahead of things and give raises preemptively, so you don't have to ask for one. It's not unusual at all for someone to receive 2+ raises per year. 10. We'll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better constantly. You'll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier. 11. 4-6+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of time off is absolutely worth it. 12. Paid Maternity/Paternity Leave. We've even started letting people skip meetings during labor! 13. Self-Funded So We Can Do What's Right for Us. We don't have to answer to anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease some selfish investor. --What are your company's values?-- See here: http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/ Yes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth checking out - it's not just normal corporate BS. We promise you'll learn a lot about us. --OK, so I've read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what the actual job is?-- No. --Wait... What?-- OK fine. Super short version: Inventing remarkable consumer products - taking concepts from ""this should exist"" to ""holy shit, why didn't this exist before"" - in the kitchen and household space. Bulleted Responsibilities: Take product concepts and figure out how to make them work elegantly Design products in CAD (we use SolidWorks, but we're flexible on software) Prototype heavily in-house (3D printing, testing, breaking, improving, repeat) Iterate relentlessly until the product hits our ""remarkable"" quality threshold Collaborate with our supply chain team on Design for Manufacturing and sourcing decisions Deliver production-ready CAD files and specifications for manufacturing Solve hard problems that don't have obvious solutions (this is like 80% of the job) To give you an idea of what we make: Beverage Barricades (the magnetic drink guard), CrocoDicer, and various kitchen gadgets that make people's lives meaningfully better. We're not making generic private label crap - we're inventing things that are genuinely novel and patentable. Fair warning: this is slow, deliberate work. A single product might take 6-36 months from concept to launch. We are quality-obsessed and refuse to ship mediocre products. If you need the dopamine hit of shipping something every week, you will be miserable here. Like everyone else in the company, you will also need to innovate regularly - which means figuring out ways to improve quality and production speed. It is challenging, but fun work that's going to require a lot of time and task management, problem-solving, and a reasonable amount of people skills. --Do I need a college degree?-- You just need to be awesome. --Are there any geographic restrictions?-- As long as you are in a country that doesn't have active sanctions from the US government, we are interested. Our founder isn't known for respecting the government much, but they have all the guns, so'¦ --Do I need an engineering degree?-- Nope. Our current product engineer is largely self-taught and didn't go to engineering school. We don't care about credentials - we care about whether you can actually invent great products. If you can demonstrate strong CAD skills and a track record of making things, that matters way more than a diploma. --What CAD software do you use?-- We currently use SolidWorks, but we're not religious about it. What matters is that you can produce production-ready 3D models. If you're proficient in Fusion 360, AutoCAD, or similar - that's fine. Just know that you'll need to come in with strong 3D modeling skills; we're not training from zero. --How many products will I work on at once?-- Typically 1-2 at a time. This is deep focus work, not juggling a dozen things. You'll spend months on a single product, iterating until it's genuinely great. --What if I've never worked in consumer products before?-- That's fine, as long as you have demonstrated ability to design and prototype physical products. Whether that came from industrial design, mechanical engineering, or just being a maker who builds stuff in your garage - we care about the skill, not the pedigree. --Do I need to deal with manufacturers directly?-- You'll collaborate with our supply chain team on Design for Manufacturing and be involved in sourcing decisions, but you won't own the vendor relationships. Supply chain handles the day-to-day communication with factories. Your job is to design products that can actually be manufactured. --What does a typical day look like?-- Variable as hell. Some days you're deep in CAD. Some days you're running prototype tests. Some days you're researching materials or competitor products. Very few meetings. Basically no bureaucracy. What's consistent is working independently, solving hard problems, and pushing toward ""remarkable."" --6-36 months per product? Really?-- Really. We iterate until it's genuinely great. We'd rather take 2 years to launch something remarkable than rush out something mediocre in 3 months. If that timeline makes you anxious, this probably isn't the role for you. --What types of products will I be working on?-- Primarily kitchen and household products. Things that solve real problems people have. We're especially interested in products that can be patented and are hard for competitors to copy. Generally, we want to either radically improve a product in its category (like 200% better) or invent a new category. --This sounds pretty good, though I'm still skeptical that this isn't a pyramid scheme.-- You sound just like the tax authorities! --That doesn't resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?-- Please submit your information on the following page to apply. We promise to respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No. There will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I'm sorry about that and thank you for sticking with us. Once you're in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don't want to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you 'yes' or 'no', and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on Tinder). Thank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!","['product', 'product designer', 'engineer', 'products', 'people', 'work', 'product', 'time', 'design', 'things', 'days', 'company', 'CAD']"

It's a virtual infrastructure teammate that understands your cloud environment, plans and executes multi-step operations, and brings domain expertise to problems ranging from spinning up complex ML infrastructures to cloud migrations to continuous compliance enforcement.

What makes Neo possible is infrastructure-as-code: by modeling cloud infrastructure in code space, we can leverage the fact that LLMs are already excellent at coding to affect cloud infrastructure changes. Combined with Pulumi's registry and petabytes of deployment history, we have a unique foundation for building infrastructure intelligence.

We're looking for engineers to build all aspects of Neo: from agent orchestration and tool interfaces to the web experience where users watch Neo work, approve operations, and understand its reasoning, to the interface with the models and how we orchestrate and fine-tune them to maximize impact. We seek bold thinkers to reimagine the entirety of cloud engineering.

While Pulumi is headquartered in Seattle, WA., we are dedicated to being a remote first company. This role will be located remotely. 

**Responsibilities**
- Build the planning and execution systems that let Neo safely perform multi-step infrastructure operations across AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, and more
- Design tool interfaces that give the agent semantic understanding of cloud resources and access to engineering workflows
- Develop the context systems that help Neo understand each customer's infrastructure patterns and usage

From product analytics, to marketing, to support, to advertising, advanced data analysis in the warehouse, and even sales ' customer data is the raw material for each function at a modern business. For highly regulated businesses in healthcare, it's always been a challenge to harness that customer data and get it to the marketing and analytics tools that require it while following patient privacy laws '¦.until now. Something as simple as running ads to get more users is simple for an e-commerce of software company to do. But common web analytics and advertising tools collect sensitive user identifiers and healthcare information automatically. Those same tools are not HIPAA compliant. We provide a layer of data governance to make current web analytics tools HIPAA-compliant. For analytics, our customers can continue getting the insights they need to improve the patient experience. For marketing, Freshpaint safeguards health information while helping our customers promote access to care through popular advertising platforms like Facebook, Google, and others. In short, we help healthcare marketers promote access to care and safeguard patient privacy at the same time. This is an important, complex problem in a massive market (healthcare is 20% of the US GDP). Our customers manage their customer data with: Privacy Platform.

We're backed by leading investors including Y-Combinator, Intel Capital, and angel investors like the Head of Data from Slack, Head of Data at LinkedIn, and more. Who we are: Freshpaint was founded by web analytics veterans who realized how hard it was for highly regulated companies to collect and use customer data in a compliant way. We started as part of Y Combinator's S19 cohort and have been focused on enabling healthcare companies collect, safeguard, and activate patient data since. In 2022 the government issued updated guidance around HIPAA, basically making our software a requirement to use for healthcare companies. As a result, we're one of the fastest growing software companies on earth right now. Our team has deep analytics and growth experience, with all of us coming from high-growth companies like Heap, Pendo, Iterable, Quantum Metric, and Retool.

About Orennia

Orennia provides an all-in-one platform for accurate data, predictive analytics and actionable insights across the energy transition. We drive faster capital allocation decisions and help our clients maximize returns across the solar, wind, storage, power, RNG, CCUS, clean fuels and hydrogen sectors. The technology that powers Orennia's platform delivers an unparalleled experience, distilling information into actionable insights to give our clients a competitive edge.

As the world decarbonizes its energy stack, trillions in capital need to be deployed. Global investment in the energy transition must quadruple to over $5 trillion annually to stay on the 1.5Â°C pathway, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. Without accurate data and predictive analytics, developers and investors will struggle to deploy capital efficiently and maximize returns. Orennia's platform expedites the energy transition with effective and robust information for smarter capital allocation choices.

ZÃ³calo Health is the first tech-driven provider built specifically for Latinos, by Latinos.

Founded in 2021 on the idea that our communities deserve more than just safety nets, we are backed by leading healthcare and social impact investors in the country to bring our vision to life.

Our mission is to improve the lives of our communities'communities that have dealt with generations of poor experiences.

At ZÃ³calo Health, we meet our members where they are, bringing care into their homes and neighborhoods through our team of community-based care providers and virtual care offerings.

We partner with community-based organizations, local healthcare providers, and health plans that recognize the value of culturally aligned care, which are not limited to brief interactions in an exam room. Together, we are building a new experience that revolves around the use of modern technology, culturally competent primary care, behavioral health, and social services to provide a radically better experience of care for every member, their family, and the communities we serve.

We are committed to expanding our reach to serve more members and their communities. We are looking for passionate individuals who share our belief that healthcare should be accessible, personalized, and rooted in the community. Join us in our mission to ensure that no one has to navigate the complexities of the healthcare system alone and that everyone receives the local, culturally competent care they deserve.
