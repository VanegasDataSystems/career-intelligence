    "description_clean": "About Empassion\nEmpassion is a Management Services Organization (MSO) focused on improving the quality of care and costs on an often neglected \"Advanced illness/ end of life\" patient population, representing 4 percent of the Medicare population but 25 percent of its costs. The impact is driven deeper by families who are left with minimal options and decreased time with their loved ones. Empassion enables increased access to tech-enabled proactive care while delivering superior outcomes for patients, their communities, the healthcare system, families, and society.\n\\n\n\\n\n$155,000 - $175,000 a year\nRole Overview\nThe\nSenior Full Stack Software Engineer\nwill report directly to the Director of Technology, a seasoned technology leader with experience delivering high-quality software and managing engineering teams in high-growth environments. This role requires ownership of critical engineering initiatives and driving delivery through both individual contribution and technical leadership / mentorship.\nYou will work closely with a team of Full-Stack Engineers and collaborate with Data & Analytics and Clinical Operations teams to deliver impactful solutions.\nRemote Work & Travel\nEmpassion is a remote-first, fully distributed company across the United States, with a strong emphasis on asynchronous communication. While day-to-day work is remote, this role requires travel 3–4 times per year for company-wide and engineering off-sites, focused on strategy alignment, team culture, and complex problem solving.\nWhat Success Looks Like\n- Own design, development, testing, and maintenance of high-impact full-stack features\n- Become a system expert across our architecture:\nVue.js\nFrontend\nPython Django / Django REST Framework (DRF) APIs\nGoogle Cloud Platform (GCP) including GKE, Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL), Cloud Storage, and BigQuery\n- Advocate for pragmatic engineering and simple, robust architectures\n- Partner closely with Clinical Operations to understand workflows and translate complex business requirements into scalable technical solutions\nWhat You Will Bring\n- 5+ years of software development experience, with strong Back-End focus\n- Healthcare industry experience (strongly preferred)\n- Deep expertise building scalable Back-End Web APIs\n- Expert-level Python proficiency\n- Hands-on experience with Django and/or Django REST Framework (DRF)\n- Solid DevOps fundamentals, including:\n- CI/CD pipelines\n- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)\n- Docker & Kubernetes\n- Cloud infrastructure (GCP, Cloud SQL, Cloud Storage)\n- Strong frontend fundamentals with experience in\nVue.js\nor React\n- Advanced knowledge of relational databases, including:\n- PostgreSQL\n- Schema design\n- Indexing & query optimization\n- Experience designing complex state management systems, including state machines and rules engines\n- Self-starter mentality with a high sense of ownership and agency\n- Demonstrated accountability for production systems and code quality\n\\n\nOur Engineering Philosophy\nAt Empassion, we believe that the highest form of engineering is achieved in building simple yet robust solutions to solve complex business problems.\nOur philosophy is guided by five core principles\nMaintainability First:\nWe stay closely attuned to industry trends but choose our tools with the discretion that healthcare technology demands. We reach first for battle-tested, well-supported technologies that allow us to deliver business value quickly and ensure reliability for the patients and clinicians that depend on us. Our engineers take pride in solutions that are built to last and simple to maintain.\nMindful Innovation:\nAs technical experts, we must lead the charge in uncovering opportunities for innovation and automation across our business. We encourage the use of emergent technologies when they provide a clear, measurable impact for our most pressing business problems. Our engineers are innovators who can justify their choices with expertise and professional wisdom.\nExtreme Ownership:\nOur engineers carry a deep sense of personal accountability for everything they ship. We aren't satisfied with just completing the requirements in a ticket; we partner with stakeholders and dive deeply into business problems to ensure we are building the right thing, often identifying gaps in requirements well before they become problems in production. We view thorough documentation and rigorous self-testing of our code as non-negotiable parts of the job—not for the sake of process, but because we refuse to leave the success of our work to chance.\nBusiness-Focused Engineering:\nWe don't measure success by the frequency of releases or the number of tickets closed, but by the outcomes that we drive for our clinicians and patients. We expect every engineer on our team to possess a keen \"business sense\"—to understand the why behind a request before diving into the how. It is our responsibility to develop a deep understanding of our stakeholders' pain points and proactively propose technical solutions that address them with accuracy.\nSimplicity over Complexity :\nWe strive to write software that is simple, clear and approachable, allowing new engineers to open pull requests within their first week on the job. We are careful to avoid speculative abstractions, experimental design patterns, and other forms of over-engineering that make our systems difficult to understand, debug, and maintain.",

    "description_clean": "- Do you see crappy products everywhere and think \"I could make that so much better\"?\n- Does your brain refuse to stop solving problems, even when you're supposed to be relaxing?\n- Do you thrive in a high-stress environment filled with political infighting, bureaucracy, and corporate nonsense?\nIf so, then we are the place for you, except you might hate how nice of a company we have - filled with happy, generally competent people that don't put up with jerks. Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is.\nWe are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me.\n--Is this a real job ad?--\nYup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of different job sites. And it's not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the owner just started paying our 70ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons - we're big time, people.\nOur careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we're a pretty big deal):\nhttp://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\nAnd check out our reviews on\nGoogle\n,\nGlassdoor\n, or\nIndeed\nto see that it's not just the founder's mother who says we're cool.\n--What do you guys do?--\nWe do a lot of different things these days including selling awesome consumer products (these are just a small sampling):\n- Bad Parking Cards (\nhttps://amz.run/5Eya\n)\n- Beverage Barricades (\nhttps://amz.run/6kip\n)\n- Child Chucker (\nhttps://amz.run/9EUz\n)\nRunning this Amazon Pay-Per-Click agency: PPCFarm.com (we're really, really good at PPC)\nAnd we will soon be launching a SaaS product for inventory management.\nWe are doing our best to grow rapidly every year, and it's our intention to continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help us keep up with the growth.\n--What is your company like?--\n1. You Can Be Yourself. You don't have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO (highly encouraged), and no one will think anything of it. You don't have to dress up, or use formal language, or pretend to be something you're not - you can just be you.\n2. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn't matter what your credentials are – it matters what you get done.\n3. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your pajamas, on your schedule. And we don't care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot of work done, we're happy campers.\n4. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you're routinely working more than 45ish hours, you're gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.\n5. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done.\n6. No Micro-Management. Once you're trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren't the place for you.\n7. No Toxic/Incompetent People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean or stupid people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. You will never have to interact with someone who is an obvious idiot or straight up malicious. No toxic or incompetent people at work - could it really be? [Yes]\n8. Supportive Environment. We don't operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful – internal politics are at a minimum here.\n9. Lots of Raises. We do our absolute best to get ahead of things and give raises preemptively, so you don't have to ask for one. It's not unusual at all for someone to receive 2+ raises per year.\n10. We'll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better constantly. You'll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.\n11. 4-6+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of time off is absolutely worth it.\n12. Paid Maternity/Paternity Leave. We've even started letting people skip meetings during labor!\n13. Self-Funded So We Can Do What's Right for Us. We don't have to answer to anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease some selfish investor.\n--What are your company's values?--\nSee here:\nhttp://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\nYes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth checking out - it's not just normal corporate BS. We promise you'll learn a lot about us.\n--OK, so I've read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what the actual job is?--\nNo.\n--Wait... What?--\nOK fine. Super short version:\nInventing remarkable consumer products - taking concepts from \"this should exist\" to \"holy shit, why didn't this exist before\" - in the kitchen and household space.\nBulleted Responsibilities:\nTake product concepts and figure out how to make them work elegantly\nDesign products in CAD (we use SolidWorks, but we're flexible on software)\nPrototype heavily in-house (3D printing, testing, breaking, improving, repeat)\nIterate relentlessly until the product hits our \"remarkable\" quality threshold\nCollaborate with our supply chain team on Design for Manufacturing and sourcing decisions\nDeliver production-ready CAD files and specifications for manufacturing\nSolve hard problems that don't have obvious solutions (this is like 80% of the job)\nTo give you an idea of what we make: Beverage Barricades (the magnetic drink guard), CrocoDicer, and various kitchen gadgets that make people's lives meaningfully better. We're not making generic private label crap - we're inventing things that are genuinely novel and patentable.\nFair warning: this is slow, deliberate work. A single product might take 6-36 months from concept to launch. We are quality-obsessed and refuse to ship mediocre products. If you need the dopamine hit of shipping something every week, you will be miserable here.\nLike everyone else in the company, you will also need to innovate regularly - which means figuring out ways to improve quality and production speed.\nIt is challenging, but fun work that's going to require a lot of time and task management, problem-solving, and a reasonable amount of people skills.\n--Do I need a college degree?--\nYou just need to be awesome.\n--Are there any geographic restrictions?--\nAs long as you are in a country that doesn't have active sanctions from the US government, we are interested. Our founder isn't known for respecting the government much, but they have all the guns, so...\n--Do I need an engineering degree?--\nNope. Our current product engineer is largely self-taught and didn't go to engineering school. We don't care about credentials - we care about whether you can actually invent great products. If you can demonstrate strong CAD skills and a track record of making things, that matters way more than a diploma.\n--What CAD software do you use?--\nWe currently use SolidWorks, but we're not religious about it. What matters is that you can produce production-ready 3D models. If you're proficient in Fusion 360, AutoCAD, or similar - that's fine. Just know that you'll need to come in with strong 3D modeling skills; we're not training from zero.\n--How many products will I work on at once?--\nTypically 1-2 at a time. This is deep focus work, not juggling a dozen things. You'll spend months on a single product, iterating until it's genuinely great.\n--What if I've never worked in consumer products before?--\nThat's fine, as long as you have demonstrated ability to design and prototype physical products. Whether that came from industrial design, mechanical engineering, or just being a maker who builds stuff in your garage - we care about the skill, not the pedigree.\n--Do I need to deal with manufacturers directly?--\nYou'll collaborate with our supply chain team on Design for Manufacturing and be involved in sourcing decisions, but you won't own the vendor relationships. Supply chain handles the day-to-day communication with factories. Your job is to design products that can actually be manufactured.\n--What does a typical day look like?--\nVariable as hell. Some days you're deep in CAD. Some days you're running prototype tests. Some days you're researching materials or competitor products. Very few meetings. Basically no bureaucracy. What's consistent is working independently, solving hard problems, and pushing toward \"remarkable.\"\n--6-36 months per product? Really?--\nReally. We iterate until it's genuinely great. We'd rather take 2 years to launch something remarkable than rush out something mediocre in 3 months. If that timeline makes you anxious, this probably isn't the role for you.\n--What types of products will I be working on?--\nPrimarily kitchen and household products. Things that solve real problems people have. We're especially interested in products that can be patented and are hard for competitors to copy. Generally, we want to either radically improve a product in its category (like 200% better) or invent a new category.\n--This sounds pretty good, though I'm still skeptical that this isn't a pyramid scheme.--\nYou sound just like the tax authorities!\n--That doesn't resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--\nPlease submit your information on the following page to apply.\nWe promise to respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.\nThere will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I'm sorry about that and thank you for sticking with us.\nOnce you're in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don't want to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you \"yes\" or \"no\", and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on Tinder).\nThank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!",

From product analytics, to marketing, to support, to advertising, advanced data analysis in the warehouse, and even sales – customer data is the raw material for each function at a modern business.\nFor highly regulated businesses in healthcare, it's always been a challenge to harness that customer data and get it to the marketing and analytics tools that require it\nwhile following patient privacy laws\n....until now.\nSomething as simple as running ads to get more users is simple for an e-commerce of software company to do. But common web analytics and advertising tools collect sensitive user identifiers and healthcare information automatically. Those same tools are not HIPAA compliant.\nWe provide a layer of data governance to make current web analytics tools HIPAA-compliant. For analytics, our customers can continue getting the insights they need to improve the patient experience. For marketing, Freshpaint safeguards health information while helping our customers promote access to care through popular advertising platforms like Facebook, Google, and others.\nIn short, we help healthcare marketers promote access to care\nand\nsafeguard patient privacy at the same time.\nThis is an important, complex problem in a massive market (healthcare is 20% of the US GDP).\nOur customers manage their customer data with:\nPrivacy Platform.

We started as part of Y Combinator's S19 cohort and have been focused on enabling healthcare companies collect, safeguard, and activate patient data since.\nIn 2022 the government issued updated guidance around HIPAA, basically making our software a requirement to use for healthcare companies. As a result, we're one of the fastest growing software companies on earth right now.\nOur team has deep analytics and growth experience, with all of us coming from high-growth companies like Heap, Pendo, Iterable, Quantum Metric, and Retool.
