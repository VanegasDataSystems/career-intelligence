## Introduction

Be brief. Aim for 2–3 paragraphs.

Try to highlight what makes your project unique and different.

---

## Problem Statement

The paper provides a concise description of the main problem that your project intends to solve. The description should be easy to follow, mostly non-technical and high-level, and provide background where needed.

This section should closely follow the bullet format presented in *“Exploration – How to Write a Problem Statement”*:

- **Context**  
  State the context of the problem.

- **Issue**  
  What is the issue that needs to be solved?

- **Relevance**  
  Who has the problem or need? Why do they have this need?

- **Objective**  
  How may the issue be solved?

Single page at most. Aim for 4–5 paragraphs.

---

## Requirements

A brief introduction to the project requirements. This should logically follow your problem statement. Aim for 1–2 paragraphs.

- Bullet point listing of the most important Requirements / Stories / Features / Tasks for your software or system.
- Generalize as much as possible.
- This should be high-level and not exhaustive.

Aim for 1–2 pages.

---

## Design / Architecture

A description of your initial thoughts on the structure of the software and/or system. This should be high-level only and not exhaustive, and should logically follow from your Requirements.

1. Break the system down into high-level functional areas.
2. Provide a brief discussion of how each area supports the listed Major Requirements.
3. Iterate on this design with the team. All team members should review.

Include **at least two graphical examples** that demonstrate a screen or page mockup, design, architecture, flowchart, layout, etc.

- Choose visuals that benefit from explanation.
- Captions are required.

Aim for 2–4 pages. Use bullet lists, flow charts, block diagrams, and screen mockups where appropriate.

## Technologies

- Bullet point listing of the most important software libraries, languages, APIs, development tools, servers, or systems you expect to use.

Include a brief discussion (1–2 paragraphs) on **one important technology**, taking into account:
- Pros and cons
- Strengths and weaknesses relative to your team

---

## Important Resources (if any)

- Bullet point listing of any external resources you expect to use
- Examples: external web resources, training datasets, graphics, systems, hardware

---

## Development Plan

A listing of the high-level project tasks for **each team member**, including a **time estimate in hours** for each major project milestone.

Important notes:
- Time spent per team member should be roughly equivalent
- Minimum expectation: **10 hours per week per team member**
- If workload is too small, expand scope or add stretch goals
- If workload is too large, revise the plan

Use the following structure (repeat as needed):

### Team Member Name

#### Progress Report #1

- High-level Requirement / Story / Feature / Task (1 sentence)
- Time estimate (hours)
- Major Dependencies / Resources / Risks (if any)

(add more tasks as required)

#### Progress Report #2

- High-level Requirement / Story / Feature / Task
- Time estimate (hours)
- Major Dependencies / Resources / Risks (if any)

(add more tasks as required)

#### Progress Report #3

- High-level Requirement / Story / Feature / Task
- Time estimate (hours)
- Major Dependencies / Resources / Risks (if any)

(add more tasks as required)

#### Project Archive – Final

- High-level Requirement / Story / Feature / Task
- Time estimate (hours)
- Major Dependencies / Resources / Risks (if any)

**Total Hours:** Sum all hours for the term for this team member
