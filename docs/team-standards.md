## Project goals 
Our goal is to build a project that collects job postings, cleans and
organizes the data, lets users search jobs by skills or concepts, and
gives suggestions on what skills to learn next using AI tools. We
want to focus on practical skills and use mostly open-source tools.
## Asynchronous communication
We will mainly use Microsoft Teams for messages and updates.
Team members should try to reply within 24 hours on weekdays.
## Synchronous communication
We will use Microsoft Teams for meetings. Team members should
join meetings on time and be available during the meeting.
## Meeting logistics and preparation
We will have regular planning meetings and short standups. One
person will help guide the meeting, and we will share the agenda
before the meeting when possible. Notes or tasks will be written
down after the meeting.
## Project management tool(s)
We will use GitHub Projects to manage tasks using a Kanban-style
board (for example: To Do, In Progress, and Done) so everyone can
see progress clearly.
## Code repository 
We will use GitHub to store all of our code and project files.
## Work quality 
We will use pull requests when adding or changing code. We will try
to keep commits small and add simple tests when possible. Any big
or breaking changes should be discussed first.
## Conflict management
If there is a disagreement, we will talk about it in the team chat first.
If it cannot be resolved, we will discuss it in a meeting and try to
agree as a group.
## AI tool usage 
We are allowed to use AI tools to help with learning, debugging, and
writing code. Everyone should understand the code they submit and
be able to explain their part of the project.
## Availability expectations
Team members will let the group know ahead of time if they are busy
or unavailable so plans can be adjusted.
## Documentation 
Important setup steps and decisions will be written in the README
or other project files so everyone can follow along.
